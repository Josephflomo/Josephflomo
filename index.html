             Travelling in Depression

            When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. It started after my
             <br>
             grandparents first brought
            me to their home in France and I have now been to twenty-nine different
            <br>
             countries. Each has
            given me a unique learning experience.
             <br>

            At five, I
             <a href="marveled">
                marveled
            </a>
             at the Eiffel Tower in the city of Lights. When I was eight, I stood in the <br>
            heart of Piazza san Marco feeding hordes of pigeons, then glided down venetian waterways <br>on sleek gondolas.
             <p>
                At thirteen,
             I saw the ancient, megalithic structure of stonehenge and

                walked along the great wall of china, amazed that the <br>thousand-year-old stones were still in place just as it is in <br>

                It was through exploring cultures around the world
                that I first
                <br>
                 became interested in language. <br>
                It began with French, which tayght me the important Pronunciation.
             </p>
                 remember once asking a store ower <br> in Paris
                where Rue des Pyramides was. But when I pronounced it PYR-a-mides instead of pyr-A-mides. <br>with more accent on the A,
                she looked at me bewilderd.<br><br>In the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and aware of its similarities with <br>
                English through cognates. Baseball in Spanish, for example, is béisbol, which looks different but sounds nearly the same. <br>
                This was incredible to me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find that cognates come to <br>
                the rescue when I forget how to say something in Spanish.

                Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As I studied Chinese at my
school, I marveled how if just one
<br> 
stroke was missing from a character, the meaning is lost. I
loved how long words were formed by 
<br>
combining simpler characters, so Huǒ (火) meaning
fire and Shān (山) meaning mountain can be
 <br>
 joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means
volcano. I love spending hours at a time practicing the
 <br>
 characters and I can feel the beauty
and rhythm as I form them.
